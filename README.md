## Motivation
Made this because I have classes that separate their slides into multiple PDFs but I want to have a PDF that contains all the slides so it's easier for review!

## How to Run
- Clone this repo qnd `cd` into this repo folder
- Run `python pdfMerger.py <link1> <link2> <link3> ...` with links being the pdfs you want to have them merged. *Note: the link url you passed in have to be ending in ".pdf" format*
- Your merged PDF file will be saved in `final_res.pdf` in the current directory!
